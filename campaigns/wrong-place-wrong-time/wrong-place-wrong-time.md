# _Dramatis personae_

## _Gaffard_, a hapless hero

A 1st-level Human Barbarian (Uthgardt Tribe Member)

Gafford is a barbarian and skald from the frigid _Spine of the World_. He’s
the son of a famous barbarian (who climbed all four of the _Sister Peaks_ and
many others), and of his mother, a powerful snow sorceress.

When his father died climbing _Kelvin's Cairn_, Gaffard was kept in his
mother’s tent. Unhappy being under his mother's thumb, he escaped the confines
of his tribe and sought fortune in the warmer climes of Waterdeep.

Gaffard is extremely tall, standing “near seven-foot” in height with a
"limber-looking ranginess". Gaffard is handsome, fair of skin, with a wide
head and a long jaw. He has long reddish-blond hair, green eyes, and tends to
go bearded. By his dress (which includes hammered ornaments and wide leather
belts) and mannerisms he’s "clearly a barbarian from the Spine of the World."
Regardless of what he’s wearing, Gaffard will always be armed with a long
sword he names "Graywand" and a poniard named "Heartseeker."

Gaffard soon encountered the Fey Pouncer, and the two became fast friends and
companions.

## _The Fey Pouncer_, a plucky rake

A 1st-level Human Rogue (Urchin)

\[[PDF](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WxO0_A5raZH47uBOnJ-4PVkgnO23TLL5/preview)].

The Fey Pouncer isn’t sure where he was born, although he suspects the far
southern city of _Halagard_. His earliest memories are living in the _Forest
of Amtar_ where he served as a wizard's apprentice. After his master's home
was attacked, burned, and the wizard murdered, he fled and eventually wound up
in Waterdeep.

The Fey Pouncer is short, with a "child-like stature" and a "flat swarthy
face." As his name indicates, he dresses all in gray, with a hood made of
mouse skins and a "dainty rapier" (named "Scalpel") at his waist along with a
dirk he calls "Cat's Claw." His hair is dark, while his eyes are brown and
"shot with gold."

The Fey Pouncer soon encountered Gaffard, and the two became fast friends and
companions.

# Setting and Exposition

## Setting

Built atop a vast plateau along the northern [Sword
Coast](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Sword_Coast_North),
[Waterdeep](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rKj7YJFeNwzDrb4hZeRkfqiNGsj_8Alm/view)
is a bustling, crowded, busy mercantile city where coin is king. Waterdhavians
live life at a fast pace, and despite their fervent work ethic, they rarely
miss an opportunity to celebrate, with festivals often going on all day and
all night. In _Waterdeep_, wealth brings respect, respect earns influence, and
influence is power.

The [Dock
Ward](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1D_2aCP_2U09wGT4uEgJukstn6WBN86SQ/view)
is well-known as a district in _Waterdeep_ both unsavory and dangerous. In it
you find bawdy taverns, shady shops, dark, winding alleyways and all manner of
ruffians and ne’er-do-wells. Much of the poor live here, victims and villains
alike. Warehouses, poorhouses and tenements dominate. The streets are steep
and narrow; signs or guideposts are rare but you know your way. Near [Snail
Street](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Snail_Street) is your shabby
3rd-floor flop on [Dust
Alley](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Dust_Alley)&mdash;a bolthole good
enough for your needs.

Everything is muddy or wet from the late afternoon rain, and through clouds a
low, waning, gibbous moon shines pale yellow somewhat illuminating the street.
A good night to spend in a festhall or tavern or both. After enjoying [Three
Pearls
Nightclub](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Three_Pearls_Nightclub)
(and some burlesque), it is after midnight, and you continue to the [Bloody
Fist](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Bloody_Fist) about a block from
the festhall and across _Snail Street_.
[One-Eyed Jukk](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/One-Eyed_Jukk)&mdash;a
popular fence for armor and weapons&mdash;hawks his wares, but even at his
“low, low” prices, it is too rich for you.

## Narrative Hook

Later still in the wee hours, and both a little tipsy, you step out onto
_Snail Street_ to head back home while pulling up your cloaks against the cold
damp. A Gnome lad or laddie in rags sits aside the street, eyes you warily,
and asks for “a little coin for my poor mother”. As you regard the seeming
vagrant, two hooded figures&mdash;one quite tall, one quite short&mdash;rush past you down
the street toward the docks; their faces are hidden, but they leave an
impression in your mind. You spot the shorter one tossing something small and
dark against a nearby recessed doorway.

_What do you do?_

# Stage Directions

This thrilling and dangerous two-player one-shot adventure for D\&D 5e based
on Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser in three acts set in Waterdeep, the City of
Splendors, uses D&amp;D 2024 Player’s Handbook character creation, features,
and rules with some D&amp;D 2014 and homebrew mixed in to fill gaps.

The protagonists have more feats than the official rules provide: This is
intentional, and adds verisimilitude to Fafhrd and The Gray Mouser as player
characters. _Derring-do_ is one theme of the adventure.
