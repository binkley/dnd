This beautifully preserved long-handled wooden spoon calls to you to cook. To attune to it, you must have proficiency with [items]Cook's Utensils[/items], and then call out "Child" in a loud, clear voice. The spoon has 5 charges/day and resets each dawn.

While attuned to this spoon and holding it you can as a [action]Magic[/action] action:

Cast [spells]Purify Food and Drink[/spells] on any food or drink the spoon is presently in contact with using the command word "Betty". This consumes 2 charges.
Create a [magicitems]Bead of Nourishment[/magicitems] using the command word "Yan". The bead appears in your casting hand instantaneously. This consumes 2 charge.
Chill, warm, or flavor up to 1 cubic foot of any food or drink the spoon is in contact with as the [spells]Prestidigitation[/spells] spell does using the command word "James". This includes nourishing beads. This consumes no charges.
Scholars of magic debate the origins of the command words. Majority opinion is that these were the names of wizard's who collaborated on the spoon, and their other works have been lost; a lesser opinion is that these are non-sense words at the whimsy of item's creator; a minority opinion is that these were names of popular chefs.
