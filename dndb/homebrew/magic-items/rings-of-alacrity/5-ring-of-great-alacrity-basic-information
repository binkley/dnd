When you attune with this ring, you sense an itch to take action.

While worn and attuned, this plain, dull band increases your Initiative by +5. It always tingles, and glows brightly when when you are about to go first, ruining attempts by others to surprise you or your party who can see the bright glow.  The bright glow acts as the [spell]Light[/spell] spell until the beginning of your next turn, helping you and others see details, but also visible to all creatures.

You may cast the [spell]Gift of Alacrity[/spell] or [spell]Haste[/spell] spells instantaneously on a creature within reach with no material, somatic, or verbal components using 1 charge of this ring.  Casting in this way does not use your action.  When cast using this ring, either spell lasts until the beginning of your next turn.  This does not break concentration for other spells.  The total charges are 2/short rest.

This ring has no effect if another magic item grants bonuses to Initiative.
