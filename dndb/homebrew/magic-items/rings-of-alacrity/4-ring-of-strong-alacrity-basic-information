When you attune with this ring, you sense an itch to take action.

While worn and attuned, this plain, dull band increases your Initiative by +4. It always tingles when you about to go first, and often glows dimly, ruining attempts by others to surprise you.  (Others may notice when it glows if your ring hand is observed.)

You may cast [spell]Gift of Alacrity[/spell] instantaneously with no material, somatic, or verbal components 1/day using this ring, and casting on a creature within reach does not take your action.  When cast using this ring, the spell lasts until the start of your next turn.  This does not break concentration for other spells.

This ring has no effect if another magic item grants bonuses to Initiative.
