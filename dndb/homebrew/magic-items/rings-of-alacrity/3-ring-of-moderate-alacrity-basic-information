When you attune to this ring you sense an itch to take action.

This shiny pinky ring grants a +3 bonus to your [rules]Initiative[/rules] rolls. It often tingles when you are about to go first.

You may cast [spells]Gift of Alacrity[/spells] on yourself with a [action]Magic[/action] action 1/day using this ring. This is in addition to the bonus granted by the ring.

When another magic item grants a greater bonus to Initiative this ring may still be used to cast spells.
