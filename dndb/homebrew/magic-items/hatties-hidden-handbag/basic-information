Hattie's Hidden Handbag is just the fashion accessory for the smart set.

Hattie was known for her charm, social wit, wile, skill in magical crafting, and fashion sense. This was the handbag used when she wanted to keep secrets to herself.

When found this uncommon handbag appears a small, nondescript clutch purse, trundle bag or pouch, however inside is an extradimensional space holding up to 20 pounds of material, not exceeding a volume of 2 cubic feet. You need at least one free hand to hold the handbag, and another to access its interior. The handbag always weighs 1 pound, regardless of contents.

Placing an object in the handbag follows the normal rules for interacting with objects. Retrieving an item from the handbag requires you to use an action. When you reach into the handbag for a specific item, the item is always magically on top.

Those lacking charm and fashion sense possess this handbag for only a short time. For them the bag avoids [rules]attunement[/rules], and eventually leaves their grasp. Those attuned may chose a suitable form for the handbag such as a trudle bag or a coinpurse and freely change its appearance to match their station and dress. Caveat emptor: best to dress sharply; standards must be maintained.

You attune to the handbag by holding it against you for one turn as an object interaction and choosing a command word. When first attuned it begins closed, affixed to you, and [condition]Invisible[/condition].

You can use the command word for a [action]Magic[/action] action to open or close the item, detach it from you, or make it visible or invisble to others.  You can hand the purse to others without losing attunement. If you are [condition]unconscious[/condition] and another holds your handbag, you lose attunement.

Spells such as [spells]See Invisible[/spells] or [spells]True Seeing[/spells] reveal the handbag to the caster. [spells]Knock[/spells] or [spells]Dispell Magic[/spells] spells opens your handbag if it is visible to the caster.

The handbag has a few limitations. If it is overloaded, or if a sharp object pierces it or tears it, the handbag ruptures and is destroyed. If the handbag is destroyed, its contents are lost forever, although artifacts in the handbag always turns up again somewhere. If the handbag is turned inside out, its contents spill forth, unharmed, and the handbag must be put right before it can be used again. If a breathing creature is placed within the handbag, the creature can survive for up to 10 minutes, after which time it begins to suffocate (though few creatures would fit into the mouth of a handbag).

Placing the handbag inside an extradimensional space created by a [magicitems]bag of holding[/magicitems], [magicitems]portable hole[/magicitems], or similar item instantly destroys both items and opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate originates at the place where one item was placed inside the other. Any creature within 10 feet of the gate is pulled through and deposited in a random location on the Astral Plane. The gate then closes with a loud noise. The gate is one-way only and cannot be reopened without other means as both items were destroyed.
