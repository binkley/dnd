When you attune with this ring you sense a deeper perception of your surroundings.

While worn and attuned this plain dull band increases your [rules]Passive Perception[/rules] by +3. It often constricts slightly and sometimes glows dimly blue when there may be something worth noticing. Your companions and other creatures may notice the glow.

You may cast [spells]Detect Magic[/spells] with a [action]Magic[/action] action 1/day using this ring. The spell cast with this ring lasts until the beginning of your next turn and requires no [rules]concentration[/rules].

When another magic item grants a greater bonus to Passive Perception this ring may still be used to cast spells.
