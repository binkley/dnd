The main-gauche is used mainly to assist in defense by parrying enemy thrusts, while the dominant hand wields a [items]rapier[/items] or similar longer weapon intended for one-handed use. It is a relatively large [items]dagger[/items], having a longer and heavier blade and very long, straight quillons. Its most characteristic feature is a wide knuckleguard that curves from the quillons to the pommel and protects the hand.

The main-gauche grants the wielder a +1 bonus to AC when wielded off-hand while wielding another melee weapon in your main hand, and raises the maximum Dexterity bonus to AC of equipped armor by 1 (if such armor has a maximum) when wielded in this way.
