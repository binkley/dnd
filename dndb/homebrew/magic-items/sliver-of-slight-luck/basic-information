An aventurine sliver of luck from Tymora 1" long. Once per day you may call on this luck to make your next [rules]saving throw[/rules] an automatic 20, or a [rules]death saving throw[/rules] an automatic single success. No more than one sliver grants you success in a day; calling on Tymora again this way in the same day results in an automatic failure.

The sliver has 1 charge of luck, and resets at the next dawn.

A successful History check (DC 15) recalls rumors that Tymora has scattered a few even greater Sliver of Luck (at discretion of the DM).
