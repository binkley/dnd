Do you need a [items]ladder[/items], some [items]caltrops[/items], an [items]exotic saddle[/items], or a change into [items]fine clothes[/items], and forgot to stuff all of that into your [items]backpack[/items]?

Have no worries! This fine item fills your shopping needs. Simply add 99 gp or any item(s) of equal or greater value into the bag for it's voracious consumption. Any Common item of your exact asking exits the 3 foot mouth of the bag if it fits. If the item does not fit nothing happens. The bag mouth may be shaped to accomodate up to 5 feet in a single direction.

The item is real and indistinguishable from any other similar item. It takes a [action]Magic[/action] action to to pay the bag, and the item appears in a same space next to you at the start of your next turn. You may use the bag 2/day and it resets each dawn.

To use the bag you must speak loudly and clearly: "Bag of Present Need, I need a/an SOMETHING" where SOMETHING is the literal name of the item. If your naming of the item not exact, you may get a different item or even nothing. The bag is picky about preciseness.

Fine print: No items will appear having a cost of 100 gp or more, and all items are at the Dungeon Master's discretion, including misnamed requests. Your money is wasted if the bag does not produce what you thought you asked for. No refunds or warrantees are available.

Only payment is accepted by the bag. It is useless for storage.
