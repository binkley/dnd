These boots appear well-crafted of plain leather, but include an extradimensional space considerably larger than their outside dimensions, with an opening on one boot (either left or right) roughly 2 inch in diameter at the mouth and 6 inches deep.

This extra space can hold up to 20 pounds, not exceeding a volume of 1/8 cubic feet. The boots weigh 2 pounds, regardless of their contents. Retrieving an item or bulk contents from the boots requires a [action]Utilize[/action] action. Typically one stashes coins or gems in the boots such as roughly 2,100 copper coins (loosely packed) or 970 gold coins (weighing 1/3 oz each).

The opening to the interior space appears as stitching on the outside of the boot, and opens or closes by running a digit along its length.

If the extra space is overloaded, pierced, or torn, it ruptures and destroys the boots, and any contents are scattered in the Astral Plane. Breathing creatures inside the interior space of the boots can survive up to a number of minutes equal to 10 divided by the number of creatures (minimum 1 minute), after which time they begin to suffocate.

Placing Boots of Storing inside an extradimensional space created by a [magicitems]Heward's Handy Haversack[/magicitems], [magicitems]Portable Hole[/magicitems], or similar item instantly destroys both items and opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate originates where the one item was placed inside the other. Any creature within 10 feet of the gate is sucked through it to a random location on the Astral Plane. The gate then closes. The gate is one-way only and canâ€™t be reopened.

You may be able to craft similar boots with [items]Leatherworker's Tools[/items] and suitable rare leather.
