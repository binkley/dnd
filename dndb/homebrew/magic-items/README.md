# Magic items for D&amp;D Beyond homebrew

This is awkward as DnDB only provides web-based editing and no API, and
editing is across multiple page input areas.

## Items

- [_Bag of Present Need_](./bag-of-present-need/) &mdash; a portable vendor.
- [_Boots of Storing_](./boots-of-storing/) &mdash; hide coin on yourself.
- [_Chester's Handy Chest of Holding_](./chesters-handy-chest-of-storing/)
  &mdash; a chest form of a _Bag of Holding_.
- [_Dagger of Delight_](./dagger-of-delight/) &mdash; influence a companion.
- [_Hattie's Handsome Handbag_](./hatties-handsome-handbag/) &mdash; storage
  and makeup kit.
- [_Julia's Sating Spoon_](./julias-sating-spoon/) &mdash; everything you cook
  is delicious.
- [_Main-Gauche_](./main-gauche/) &mdash; fencing with defense.
- [_Rings of Alacrity_](./rings-of-alacrity/) &mdash; set of increasing
  improvement to initiative.
- [_Rings of Perception_](./rings-of-perception/) &mdash; set of increasing
  passive perception.

## Challenges

- Capturing text for existing items requires creating a new version that is
  deleted after copy/paste.
- Not all formatting is possible with text tags (markup).
  For example, italic, bold, and bullet points require hand-editing in the UI.
  This is lost in the text saved here.
- Each item has separate edit areas for things like charges or magic spells.
  Experiment with separate Markdown files (_eg_, `modifiers.md`).
- The distinction between "published" and "private" is not possible.
