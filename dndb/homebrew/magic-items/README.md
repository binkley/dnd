# Magic items for D&amp;D Beyond homebrew

This is awkward as DnDB only provides web-based editing and no API, and
editing is across multiple page input areas.

## Challenges

- Capturing text for existing items requires creating a new version that is
  deleted after copy/paste.
- Not all formatting is possible with text tags (markup).
  For example, italic and bold presentation require hand-editing in the UI.
  This is lost in the text saved here.
- Each item has separate edit areas for things like charges or magic spells.
- The distinction between "published" and "private" is not possible.
