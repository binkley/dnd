Hattie's Handsome Handbag is just the fashion accessory for the smart set.

Hattie was known for her charm, social wit, wile, skill in magical crafting, and fashion sense. For those who caught a glimpse of it, this handbag seemed always to match the situation and Hattie's appearance, but only she knew all its secrets. Yet those who knew Hattie claimed she had an even more marvelous handbag for special occassions.

When found this handbag appears a small, nondescript clutch purse, trundle bag or pouch, however inside is an extradimensional space holding up to 20 pounds of material, not exceeding a volume of 2 cubic feet. You need at least one free hand to hold the handbag, and another to access its interior. The handbag always weighs 1 pound, regardless of contents.

Those lacking charm and fashion sense possess this handbag for only a short time. For them the bag avoids [rules]attunement[/rules], and eventually leaves their grasp. Those attuned may chose a suitable form for the handbag such as a trudle bag or a coinpurse and freely change its appearance to match their station and dress. Caveat emptor: best to dress sharply; standards must be maintained.

In addition to its spacious capacity, it can produce on demand mundane clothing suitable for any occasion (as [magicitems]Cloak of Many Fashions[/magicitems] but for your entire outfit), and doubles as an in exhaustible [items]Disguise Kit[/items] if you have [rules]proficiency[/rules] (though undoubtedly a fashion maven such as yourself does).

You may cast [spells]Disguise Self[/spells] with this handbag 1/[rules]long rest[/rules]. The skill save DC for a creature doubting your appearance is 13 + your Charisma modifier.

Placing an object in the handbag follows the normal rules for interacting with objects. Retrieving an item from the handbag requires you to use an action. When you reach into the handbag for a specific item, the item is always magically on top.

After attuning when the handbag is held against you for one turn as an object interaction, it closes, stays in place, and becomes visible or invisible as you choose. The handbag is seen by spells such as [spells]See Invisibility[/spells] and [spells]True Seeing[/spells]. You may choose the visible appearance of the handbag as long as it matches your outfit. Sometimes less is more.

The handbag has a few limitations. If it is overloaded, or if a sharp object pierces it or tears it, the handbag ruptures and is destroyed. If the handbag is destroyed, its contents are lost forever, although an artifact that was in the handbag always turns up again somewhere. If the handbag is turned inside out, its contents spill forth, unharmed, and the handbag must be put right before it can be used again. If a breathing creature is placed within the handbag, the creature can survive for up to 10 minutes, after which time it begins to suffocate (though few creatures would fit into the mouth of a handbag).

Placing this handbag inside an extradimensional space created by a [magicitems]bag of holding[/magicitems], [magicitems]portable hole[/magicitems], or similar item instantly destroys both items and opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate originates where the one item was placed inside the other. Any creature within 10 feet of the gate is sucked through it and deposited in a random location on the Astral Plane. The gate then closes. The gate is one-way only and can't be reopened.
