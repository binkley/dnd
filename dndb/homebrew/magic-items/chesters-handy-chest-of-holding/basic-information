This chest has an interior space considerably larger than its outside dimensions, 2½ feet long, 1½ feet wide, and 1 foot tall with a half-barrel lid. The chest can hold up to 1000 pounds, not exceeding a volume of 128 cubic feet. The chest weighs 50 pounds, regardless of its contents.

A [magicitems]Lock of Trickery[/magicitems] is part of the construction and secures the chest's lid. This lock appears to be an ordinary [items]Lock[/items] and comes with a single ornate key. The mechanism of this lock magically adjust to thwart burglars. Dexterity checks made to pick the lock have [rules]Disadvantage[/rules].

Placing an object in the chest follows the normal rules for interacting with objects. Retrieving an item from the chest requires you to use an action. When you reach into the chest for a specific item, the item is always magically on top.

If the chest is overloaded, pierced, or torn, it ruptures and is destroyed, and its contents are scattered in the Astral Plane. If the chest is turned upside down, its contents spill forth, unharmed, but the chest must be put right before it can be used again. Breathing creatures inside the chest can survive up to a number of minutes equal to 10 divided by the number of creatures (minimum 1 minute), after which time they begin to suffocate.

Placing the chest inside an extradimensional space created by a [magicitems]bag
of holding[/magicitems], [magicitems]Heward's handy haversack[/magicitems], [magicitems]portable hole[/magicitems], or similar item instantly destroys both items and opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate originates where the one item was placed inside the other. Any creature within 10 feet of the gate is sucked through it to a random location on the Astral Plane. The gate then closes. The gate is one-way only and can’t be reopened.
