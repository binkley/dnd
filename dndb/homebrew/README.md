# D&amp;D Beyond homebrew

Note that markup (BBC) tags are subtley different between 2024 and 2014
versions of the same thing.
2024 uses _plural_ for many tags that 2014 uses _singular_ for, and this is
apparent in rendered DnDB pages when mixing tags.

Unless you intend to refer specifically to the 2014 verion of something, you
should prefer the 2024 version in your tags.

The [_How to add
tooltips_](https://www.dndbeyond.com/forums/dungeons-dragons-discussion/homebrew-house-rules/9811-how-to-add-tooltips)
page is outdated.

In all cases, tags to 3<sup>rd</sup>-party/partner content may change without
warning.
An example is referring to `[spell]Gift of Alacrity[/spell]` from _Explorer's
Guide to Wildemont_:
This worked originally with homebrew content for pre-2024 `[spell]`, but
produces a fatal warning on save with 2024 `[spells]`.

The below table _prefers_ 2024 options so those are in bold.
This seems to be a "moving target" as DnDB updates how tags are handled, and
2014 items missing or renamed in 2024 may change how they are presented.
Also when an item is unchanged in title between editions, you may struggle
referring to the previous 2014 version.
